The website's codebase is not version controlled, making it difficult to track changes and collaborate effectively.</p><h2>Comparative Analysis</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>GoDaddy</th><th>Azure App Service</th><th>MASCOM via Github Pages + Cloudflare</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Scalability</td><td>Limited scalability, may experience performance issues under heavy traffic.</td><td>Highly scalable, can easily handle traffic spikes and growing business needs.</td><td>Highly scalable due to the distributed nature of GitHub Pages and Cloudflare's CDN.</td></tr><tr><td>Performance</td><td>Slower loading times due to shared resources.</td><td>Faster loading times due to dedicated resources and content delivery network (CDN).</td><td>Optimized performance through Cloudflare's CDN and caching features.</td></tr><tr><td>Security</td><td>Basic security features, vulnerable to attacks.</td><td>Robust security features, including web application firewall (WAF) and DDoS protection.</td><td>Advanced security measures provided by Cloudflare, including DDoS protection, WAF, and SSL.</td></tr><tr><td>Cost</td><td>Lower cost, but may incur additional expenses for performance and security enhancements.</td><td>Higher cost, but includes built-in performance and security features.</td><td>Cost-effective solution leveraging free GitHub Pages hosting and Cloudflare's free tier.</td></tr><tr><td>Maintenance</td><td>Requires manual updates and maintenance.</td><td>Simplified maintenance with automatic updates and patching.</td><td>Automated deployments through GitHub Actions and simplified maintenance with Cloudflare.</td></tr><tr><td>Version Control</td><td>No built-in version control, making collaboration and tracking changes difficult.</td><td>Can be integrated with Git for version control.</td><td>Built-in version control with Git, enabling seamless collaboration and deployment.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> We recommend implementing Mobleysoft Autonomous Systems Controller and Optimization Manager (MASCOM), utilizing GitHub Pages for hosting and Cloudflare for enhanced performance and security.</p></section><section id="crm"><h2>CRM
